Sorcery bars the last door between the woman and her prey; a quick word and a gesture and the heretic's barrier spell is ravaged. The burnt bones and stars had shown her his home. The words that guided her blade ringed clearly in her head as she crept towards the heretic's sleeping form. Her knife pulsed with energy, poised high above the false prophet, the spell of silence would handle her next problem...}",

Lighting a fire, the seeker doesn’t look up as he continues to rummage in his bag, “if you prefer to get out of this in one piece, then just keep them at bay, this brew will fix everything.” The tea leaves glow with a brilliant green light as the water comes to a boil.
